=== tilde(~) and caret(^) ===

Syntex (major.minor.patch)

1. tilde(~) : - It is used to match the most recent patch version. for eg. if version is v-1.2.3 and patch updated then tilde automatically update its dependency to (v.1.2.*)

2. caret(^) : - It is used to match the most recent minor or patch version. for eg. if version is v-1.2.3 and minor or patch updated then caret automatically update its dependency to (v.1.*.*)    

3. if we dont use any notation in npm it will consider (^) notation by default.
